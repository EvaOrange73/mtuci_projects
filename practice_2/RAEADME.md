this is my educational:mortar_board: project. 
It is translator based on Azure API:ok_hand:
## How it looks
![screenshoot](https://github.com/EvaOrange73/mtuci_projects/blob/main/practice_2/app/static/photos/screenshot.jpg)
## Using
To use my code:eyes: you need to add `config.py` file in `app`. This file should contain the following code:
```python
subscription_key = ''
location = ''
```
You should get the subscription key:key: and location:dart: from Azure. The key looks like long string of letters and numbers:trollface:, location can be like `westeurope`.
